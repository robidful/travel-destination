            <h4>Why Seoul?</h4>
            <h3>Seoul, the so called "Special City"</h3>
            <p>
              Seoul, officially the Seoul Special Metropolitan City, is the
              capital and largest metropolis of the Republic of Korea (commonly
              known as South Korea). Seoul is the world's 16th largest city, and
              forms the heart of the Seoul Capital Area, which includes the
              surrounding Incheon metropolis and Gyeonggi province. The Seoul
              Capital Area houses about half of the country's population of
              51.44 million people with 678,102 international residents.
              Situated on the Han River, Seoul's history stretches back more
              than two thousand years when it was founded in 18 BC by Baekje,
              one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Seoul is considered a leading and rising global city,
              resulting from an economic boom called the Miracle on the Han
              River, which transformed it to the world's 4th largest
              metropolitan economy with a GDP of US$845.9 billion in 2014 after
              Tokyo, New York City and Los Angeles.

            I would love to visit Seoul in 2025 and therefore I thought about
            gathering some info about this city and share it with you.
